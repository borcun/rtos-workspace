* STM32F429 LED Blink Project on Debian
** Prerequisities
- Firstly, look at device whether it is defined by your operating system
  We expect that output of /lsusb/ lists STM board as the following image depicts
  [[img/lsusb.png]]

- Then load toolchain and a few tools (openocd for debugging, stlink-tools for the board by the vendor)
  - gcc-arm-none-eabi gdb-arm-none-eabi binutils-arm-none-eabi openocd stlink-tools
    /Note that if gdb is not found into the repo, install gdb-multiarch instead./

- For prevent 'Permission Denied' error, you may put the following text into */etc/udev/rules.d/49-stlinkv2.rules* file.
  /Unless presence specified, create it./
  - SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0483", ATTRS{idProduct}=="374b", MODE="0666"
    /Your product may has different id, so put yours for idProduct attribute/

- Next, active your rules executing the following commands with root permission
  - udevadm control --reload-rules
  - udevadm trigger

- Finally, you will see output of /st-info --probe/ command on screen like \
  [[img/st-info.png]]

** OpenOCD
It is an open source tool that provides remote debugging between host and target. Additionally, you may flash binary file
check hardware pins using OpenOCD. It works like a GDB Server on host via connection target. It serves host debugger to
connect to target over a web service.

- Run /openocd -f interface/stlink.cfg -f target/stm32f4x.cfg/ on host terminal, then see the following output
  [[img/openocd.png]]

** Connecting & Running Application on Target
- After running OpenOCD in a terminal, build _blinking PG13 LED_ project on another terminal
  /Makefile uses main.c and stm32f429.ld files in turn as source code and linker directive files/

- Execute /gdb-multiarch blink.elf/ command to run debugger client on host firstly, then the following commands on gdb
  - /set architecture arm/
  - /target extended-remote :3333/
  - /monitor reset halt/
  - /load/
  - /monitor reset init/
  - /continue/

- Finally, you will see that PG13 LED is blinking
